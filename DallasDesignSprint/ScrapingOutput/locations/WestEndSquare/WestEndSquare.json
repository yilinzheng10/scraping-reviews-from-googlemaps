      "comment": "Great new little park in the West End.  It has swings, a fountain, walking paths and games such as Foose ball and ping-pong.  The park has ample seating for people to take a break from their afternoon adventures.   It has charging stations for your electronics and it has overhead fans in some places so you can cool off.  It is beautifully landscaped and it has dedicated areas near the front of the park as pet relief areas. +19",

It's about a block in area, but it holds lots of beauty.\n\nI sat and admired the beautiful contents. Trees, lilies, flowers.  It also has a water table with water spurting upward. Suddenly and unexpectedly,  the water became misty and i was sprayed eith the coolness of the mist. I gasped.\n\nThere are swings and plenty of seating for the many visitors. The swings were occupied with, what seem like, lovers enjoying each others company.\n\nLate evenings, the sun is perched behind a 5 story apartment building. The air is cool. The park is inviting as many visitors stopped by to admire its beauty.\n\nThe park has a calming effect on me and I'm sure others. I could sit for hours. I sat for hours.\n\nIt's a wonder.",

There are far too many parking lots in Downtown Dallas so this park was a great way to replace an old parking lot with something the community can enjoy all year. This is also close to the new Dallas Holocaust and Humans Rights Museum. Exciting times in this neighborhood!",
