It features open green spaces, walking trails, and playgrounds, making it ideal for families and outdoor enthusiasts. The park is great for picnics, casual strolls, and enjoying nature without leaving the city. It's known for being clean and safe, with plenty of benches and shaded areas. A nice spot to relax or get some fresh air with friends or family.\n\nWant me to add details about facilities or nearby attractions?",

Just wave and say hi to them and go on with your day like you would have if it had been someone with a house there.\n\nI saw someone say that we can't use the dog park because homeless people sleep in it? Well then walk your dog before 11pm when the dog park closes. The homeless respect the dog park hours believe it or not, if they're in there sleeping on the non-anti-homeless-benches then it's prob 11pm-5am type shit when the dog park is suppose be closed lol",

They provide parking spaces for visitors.\n\nThere is a couple of basketball courts, a path that runs the entire length of the park and surrounds the park as well. There is a beautiful view of downtown Dallas. The grass consists of beautiful greenery.",

I had not actually been to it until I attended Wine Festival in August of 2024. There are some street parking spaces along the side of the park that appear to be first come first served; either that or they are metered. There are also paid parking lots very near by. I personally would not regularly go to the park because of the geographic location, but would attend another event  if it were held there.PlaygroundTo my knowledge there is not a playground.RestroomsI do not believe there is a restroom.Dog-friendlinessThe park is dog friendly.Picnic areaIt would be a good place for a picnic",
