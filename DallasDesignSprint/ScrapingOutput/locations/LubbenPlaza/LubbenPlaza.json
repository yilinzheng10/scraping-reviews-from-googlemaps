      "comment": "Wonderful park situated in downtown Dallas. It’s located across from the Omni Dallas Hotel. Very peaceful. I see a huge mass of iron. There are chairs for sitting and thinking as this iron mass moves around the circle. I refer to it as a sundial. However it’s far from being a sundial. It make s a complete revolution every day. As I sit there, I can hear it move, minute by minute. I generally visit three times a day to see where the sundial has moved. It’s an amazing piece of art work.",

Take that as you will, i feel each person will have there very own magical experience at this spot in west downtown Dallas, Tx.\n\nHave a Beautifully, Intentional Day!",

By the time we made it here it was dark, and homeless people were beginning to set up camp in the park for the night.  Maybe it's a nice place to visit during the day, but I definitely didn't feel safe there at night.",

I caught the moon just as it was rising over the building next door. The red horse neon lit was perfectly positioned to give perspective on the whole scene.",
