    "comment": "Carpenter Park review:\n\nCarpenter Park is a charming, well-kept community park that offers a peaceful environment for visitors. It features open green spaces, walking trails, and playgrounds, making it ideal for families and outdoor enthusiasts. The park is great for picnics, casual strolls, and enjoying nature without leaving the city. It's known for being clean and safe, with plenty of benches and shaded areas. A nice spot to relax or get some fresh air with friends or family.\n\nWant me to add details about facilities or nearby attractions?",

Just wave and say hi to them and go on with your day like you would have if it had been someone with a house there.\n\nI saw someone say that we can't use the dog park because homeless people sleep in it? Well then walk your dog before 11pm when the dog park closes. The homeless respect the dog park hours believe it or not, if they're in there sleeping on the non-anti-homeless-benches then it's prob 11pm-5am type shit when the dog park is suppose be closed lol",

I had not actually been to it until I attended Wine Festival in August of 2024. There are some street parking spaces along the side of the park that appear to be first come first served; either that or they are metered. There are also paid parking lots very near by. I personally would not regularly go to the park because of the geographic location, but would attend another event  if it were held there.PlaygroundTo my knowledge there is not a playground.RestroomsI do not believe there is a restroom.Dog-friendlinessThe park is dog friendly.Picnic areaIt would be a good place for a picnic",

When she noticed that the office was closed, she walked back with me and showed me another place where I could get help. She was very kind and friendly, and even though it wasn’t part of her job, she guided me out of pure kindness. The security officers at the entrance and on the second floor were also very kind and helpful",

I was at Kroger this morning and DFD had a ladder truck there to get groceries (I think Truck 19). My son loves fire trucks (he’s 5) and so we walked over to look at the truck. I thought all the firefighters were inside, but as we walked up to the truck, one of the firefighters was sitting in the front. He waved at us and as soon as we got close he jumped out and started talking to my son. He offered to show him the back, he was super friendly and seemed genuinely excited to show a young child his truck. It was incredibly nice and I just wanted to say thank you. It made a kid’s day, he talked about it the whole way home! Unfortunately I did not catch the firefighter’s name but he was a Lieutenant. That kind of community outreach is so important and deserves recognition. If anyone in the Dallas government knows who it might have been, tell him thank you for me.",

The event was no where near half full.\nKids crying to get in and family’s sitting the curbs around the gates trying to get a glimpse of the action.\n\nWe were one of the few lucky family’s to get in & believe me it was such a sad scene. We tried talking to a few of the event people but was told “we don’t know why but they said don’t let anyone else in because we are full....”\nHorrible scene......\n\nAlso they nearly jumbled and passed the countdown due to host having no clue what was going on.\n\nWe won’t ever return and goes to show #DallasHospitality.......👎🏼",

The flowers are perennial and can be seen year round. As I stood there admiring its glory, I wondered how spectacular it will look come spring.\n\nThe spurting fountain has approximately 6 threads appearing to shoot from underneath the ground.  It's a wonderful site to see and get pictures.\n\nI sit for a spell sometimes to admire its beauty.",

I give it 4 stars because it only has one wheelchair accessible ramp on the Houston St entrance.\nThe fountain was not running during my visit and there was a bit of trash floating in it. Otherwise the plaza was well maintained.  The plaza is on a number of bus routes and is across the street from the DART Blueline.  It's also a short walk from Dealey plaza.\nThe old newspaper building is on one side of the plaza while a newer hotel is on the other.\nIt's a nice place for a walk or a photo shoot.  It would be especially beautiful if the trees had lights on them and the fountain was running.",

There are chairs for sitting and thinking as this iron mass moves around the circle. I refer to it as a sundial. However it’s far from being a sundial. It make s a complete revolution every day. As I sit there, I can hear it move, minute by minute. I generally visit three times a day to see where the sundial has moved. It’s an amazing piece of art work.",

    "comment": "The park was conveniently located to our hotel, Residence Inn, so we came a couple times while in Dallas for the weekend. Our first impression was half of it was under construction making it hard to figure out how to get in. Once we walked around to an opening, there were homeless people everywhere just laying around or sitting and staring. So that made it a bit uncomfortable. The playground was nice for our kids to enjoy while we killed time, and the tree landscaping is well done and mature. It took me awhile to figure out where the classical music was coming from and realized it was in the park.  A nice little touch. Overall I think it'd be nice to see it on a good day because we probably caught it on an off day. But I can appreciate it for what it might usually be.",

For the most part this park would be a nice place to visit, but in mid-November shaded by all the tall buildings it was a little chilly. The park was decorated very nicely for the holiday. As a parent however all I could think about was the safety of my children with all the homeless people in the park. It is not a place I would send my young children alone, but my kids had fun and didn't even notice all of the grown ups \"hanging out\" at the park. +2",

It’s looks to have a more purpose to serve to business folk who needs to do a phone, fresh air, or lunch break.\n\nI took my dog. On google review, there was mention of unleashing my dog on the grass...... to my disappointment, not grass. I also could not let her in an extended measure because so many people. It was just uncomfortable to bring her.\n\nFor me. As I said. Pretty park. Had places to sit. Had a view of all around.\n\nA reviewer mention about homeless people. They add to how free this park is. I did see one and they walked from one side to the other and than sat in the shade. No harm no foul. And I was ok. My attitude didn’t change on the park. +6",

I was telling a friend about it and she said she visited the park when it first opened and there were to many people in park that made her a little nervous. Maybe that was true in the past but its not now. The security and Mark are great. People are kind and the area is very clean!!

It's about a block in area, but it holds lots of beauty.\n\nI sat and admired the beautiful contents. Trees, lilies, flowers.  It also has a water table with water spurting upward. Suddenly and unexpectedly,  the water became misty and i was sprayed eith the coolness of the mist. I gasped.\n\nThere are swings and plenty of seating for the many visitors. The swings were occupied with, what seem like, lovers enjoying each others company.\n\nLate evenings, the sun is perched behind a 5 story apartment building. The air is cool. The park is inviting as many visitors stopped by to admire its beauty.\n\nThe park has a calming effect on me and I'm sure others. I could sit for hours. I sat for hours.\n\nIt's a wonder.",
