It features open green spaces, walking trails, and playgrounds, making it ideal for families and outdoor enthusiasts. The park is great for picnics, casual strolls, and enjoying nature without leaving the city. It's known for being clean and safe, with plenty of benches and shaded areas.

Just wave and say hi to them and go on with your day like you would have if it had been someone with a house there. I saw someone say that we can't use the dog park because homeless people sleep in it Well then walk your dog before 11pm when the dog park closes. The homeless respect the dog park hours believe it or not, if they're in there sleeping on the non-anti-homeless-benches then it's prob 11pm-5am type shit when the dog park is suppose be closed lol",

I had not actually been to it until I attended Wine Festival in August of 2024. There are some street parking spaces along the side of the park that appear to be first come first served; either that or they are metered. There are also paid parking lots very near by. I personally would not regularly go to the park because of the geographic location, but would attend another event if it were held there.PlaygroundTo my knowledge there is not a playground.RestroomsI do not believe there is a restroom.Dog-friendlinessThe park is dog friendly.Picnic areaIt would be a good place for a picnic",

The eviction process is nothing but a game to this city... There is no housing programs for working people there is no program for the young men or children and the young men grown up.To busy trying to lock people up and give them chargers to mess there future up!! But worried about parks but people can't even go to parks without being harassed by your polices...this city ain't what it use to be.. Become a victim of identity and try to explain that to the DPS they laugh at you..but what if it was your identity taken advantage by relatives..or etc..Alot of important people spoke up and made this city but the people we got representing the City of Dallas are weak and only paying there bills Pay the city you can do whatever you want",

I was at Kroger this morning and DFD had a ladder truck there to get groceries (I think Truck 19). My son loves fire trucks (he’s 5) and so we walked over to look at the truck. I thought all the firefighters were inside, but as we walked up to the truck, one of the firefighters was sitting in the front. He waved at us and as soon as we got close he jumped out and started talking to my son. He offered to show him the back, he was super friendly and seemed genuinely excited to show a young child his truck. It was incredibly nice and I just wanted to say thank you. It made a kid’s day, he talked about it the whole way home! Unfortunately I did not catch the firefighter’s name but he was a Lieutenant. That kind of community outreach is so important and deserves recognition. If anyone in the Dallas government knows who it might have been, tell him thank you for me",

You bring your own mat and whatever else you may need to feel comfy in the Texas heat while working out and enjoy 45 minutes of a guided yoga session. They also have activities for kids, park areas, and there are food trucks located nearby if you’re looking for something to eat. Parking is harder to come by so highly recommend giving yourself an extra 15 minutes to find it before any scheduled event.RestroomsThere are restrooms accessible in the park.Dog-friendlinessYou can walk your dogs on a leash in the park.Picnic areaLots of places to sit and enjoy a meal whether it’s from a park restaurant, food truck or a picnic you enjoy on the grass",

Our first impression was half of it was under construction making it hard to figure out how to get in. Once we walked around to an opening, there were homeless people everywhere just laying around or sitting and staring. So that made it a bit uncomfortable. The playground was nice for our kids to enjoy while we killed time, and the tree landscaping is well done and mature. It took me awhile to figure out where the classical music was coming from and realized it was in the park.  A nice little touch. Overall I think it'd be nice to see it on a good day because we probably caught it on an off day. But I can appreciate it for what it might usually be.",
