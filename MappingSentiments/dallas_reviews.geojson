The only thing was there was a large group of homeless people (30+) sleeping in one corner of the park which was a bit weird. One of my favorite parks in Dallas. Is a Great Plaze to spend when your family! Great park outside the smell of weed. Puptopia was held here and Dexter really enjoyed himself! Hope more events are held at this plaza!",
